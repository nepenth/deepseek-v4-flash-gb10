# Spark-specific integration

FlashInfer includes the native SM120/SM121 DeepSeek V4 sparse MLA kernel, but
the pinned vLLM wrapper does not fully describe Spark's NVFP4 layout. The
overlay provides the missing integration:

- routes `nvfp4` to the `nvfp4_ds_mla` packed `uint8` cache format;
- uses the 584-byte token layout required by the native kernel;
- preserves valid compressed C128 pages while normalizing SWA cache tensors;
- supports TP=2 query-head geometry;
- pads 256-wide DSpark draft indices to the native 512-wide dispatch using
  `-1` sentinels without changing active lengths;
- carries the b12x NVFP4 MoE integration used by the validated runtime.

The b12x adapter registers `flashinfer_b12x` with vLLM's modular MXFP4 oracle,
prepares the checkpoint's native MXFP4 tensors into b12x's W4A16 runtime
format, plans caller-owned scratch, and rejects allocations during CUDA graph
capture. The small-M selector override is opt-in/configurable through the
`VLLM_B12X_W4A16_*` environment variables.

## B12X route-pack startup warmup

B12X route packing uses Triton kernels specialized by both a power-of-two
route capacity and the divisibility of the live route count. Previously, a new
long-prefill shape could compile `_pack_topk_routes_prefix_kernel` after
request execution began. If compilation occurred during CUDA graph capture,
it could terminate the engine.

Each TP rank now prewarms route packing during model loading, before CUDA graph
capture. It covers every power-of-two capacity through
`MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS`; for capacities greater than two, it warms both the
aligned capacity and capacity minus one. Those calls cover Triton's aligned
and generic scalar specializations. The completed warmup is cached per CUDA
device, expert count, top-k, and maximum capacity. With the default
`MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=8192`, startup increases by approximately 10--11
seconds per rank and adds no request-path warmup.

The expected startup log is:

```text
Prewarmed B12X route-pack capacities (...) on cuda:0 (experts=256, topk=6)
```

## JIT monitor

Compose enables vLLM's JIT monitor in warning mode by default. Set these values
in both node environment files when more detail is needed:

```bash
JIT_MONITOR_MODE=warn
JIT_MONITOR_VERBOSE=1
```

`warn` reports unexpected inference-time compilation while allowing the server
to continue. `error` is intended only for cold-start validation: it terminates
the engine on any previously unwarmed kernel, including kernels unrelated to
B12X.

A cold TP=2 run with `JIT_MONITOR_MODE=error` completed 33,966-, 36,549-, and
40,720-token prefill requests without route-pack compilation. A subsequent
65,536-token test exposed separate first-use specializations in vLLM's indexer
(`_build_prefill_chunk_metadata_kernel`) and the CuTeDSL
`W4A16FusedMoeKernel`. The first decode matrix also compiled a dflash input
preparation shape. None was a route-pack kernel, so the result validates this
fix but is not yet a full-stack zero-JIT guarantee for every cold request. Use
`warn` for normal serving until those independent warmup gaps are addressed.

The new backend was informed by `voipmonitor`'s earlier Apache-2.0 b12x vLLM
integration in vllm-project/vllm pull request 39634, then expanded for the
current vLLM modular-MoE APIs and the tested DeepSeek V4 TP=2 path. Full
provenance is in `CREDITS.md`.

All upstream revisions are pinned in `upstream.lock` so a build cannot silently
move to incompatible wrapper or kernel behavior. In particular, b12x is pinned
to Git commit `7dc6fb8f`; its package reports `0.15.3`, but that version was not
published to PyPI.
